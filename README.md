## hi, i'm valerie! ☕

this space is a digital notebook where i test ideas that live between  
healthcare, policy, and systems of care that don’t just sound good on paper.

i'm super new to coding, but some of these projects came from ideas  
that wouldn’t leave me alone lol.

right now, i’m exploring:
- visualizing health insurance gaps across counties  
- tools that help people slow down + focus (because burnout isn’t sustainable policy)  
- building toward something part nonprofit, part startup, part think tank

### things i’ve made:
- [moku noru](https://github.com/valerieshoker/mokunoru): a minimalist chrome extension for clarity and calm  
- [valerieshoker-site](https://github.com/valerieshoker/valerieshoker-site): a personal website: part bookshelf, part scrapbook, part experiment

### currently building:
- Health Access Explorer: an interactive dashboard visualizing health insurance gaps by county with demographic overlays + policy timelines

_(not live yet but ask me about them!)_
