## Hi, I'm Valerie! ☕ 

This space is a digital notebook where I test ideas that live between healthcare, policy, and systems of care that don’t just sound good on paper.

### Things I’ve Made

- **[Moku Noru (Chrome Extension)](https://github.com/valerieshoker/mokunoru)**  
  A minimalist focus tool with Pomodoro timer, task bins (Today/Later), and a bouncing cat when you add a task.  
  _Tech: Vanilla JS, CSS, HTML_

- **[valerieshoker-site](https://github.com/valerieshoker/valerieshoker-site)**  
  A personal website: part bookshelf, part scrapbook, part experiment.  
  _Deployed on Vercel_

- **Health Access Explorer**  
  An interactive dashboard that visualizes health insurance disparities by county, with demographic overlays and policy timelines.  
  _Tech: React, Mapbox, Vite, TypeScript_  
  _Not live yet—but ask me about it!_

### Tech Stack

`JavaScript` • `TypeScript` • `CSS` • `HTML`
